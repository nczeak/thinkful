If signups were directly related to how much the company spends on marketing, and marketing spend was lower in the recent timeframe, then I would suggest increasing the marketing spend to increase signups. I would also evaluate if there was a significant dropoff in a step in the signup process, and evaluate how long a successful completion of the step usually takes. If successful completion takes too long, then I would tell the company to try and make the step less complicated."

If users tend to like a more cost-efficient hotel that is available, my ranking system would rank only available hotels by their cost efficiency from highest to lowest."

I would then use the average length of session, logins per day, and the timestamp distribution from that steady time. I would compare those metrics from the steady timespan to the same metrics from the recent month to determine if the recent churn was atypical."
